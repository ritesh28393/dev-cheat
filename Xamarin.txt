INTRO
	The static Task.WhenAny and Task.WhenAll methods are used to run multiple asynchronous methods concurrently
		await Task.WhenAny<bool>  //When the second task completes, the Task.WhenAny method call completes
		(
			image.RotateTo (360, 4000),
			image.ScaleTo (2, 2000)
		);
		await image.ScaleTo (1, 2000);
	40 units = 1/4 inch on mobile devices
	Device class function 
		StartTimer(TimeSpan interval, Func<bool> callback) - While the callback returns true, the timer will keep recurring.
		OpenUri(Uri uri) - This often navigates out of the application
	switch (Device.RuntimePlatform) - Executes differently depending on the platform
	
ANIMATION
	There is no XAML interface for animation classes. However, animations can be encapsulated in behaviors and then referenced from XAML.
	The ViewExtensions class provides extension methods that rotate, scale, translate, and fade VisualElement instances.
	The ViewExtensions class also includes a CancelAnimations method that can be used to cancel any animations.
	Easing class allows to specify how to control animations to speed up or to slow down as they're running
	Simple Animations
		TranslateTo animates the TranslationX and TranslationY properties of a VisualElement.
		ScaleTo animates the Scale property of a VisualElement.
		RelScaleTo applies an animated incremental increase or decrease to the Scale property of a VisualElement.
		RotateTo animates the Rotation property of a VisualElement.
		RelRotateTo applies an animated incremental increase or decrease to the Rotation property of a VisualElement.
		RotateXTo animates the RotationX property of a VisualElement.
		RotateYTo animates the RotationY property of a VisualElement.
		FadeTo animates the Opacity property of a VisualElement.
	Compound Animations
		It is a sequential combination of animations, and can be created with the await operator
		ex - Image is translated over 6 seconds. The subsequent animation methods execute after the previous method has completed.
			await image.TranslateTo (-100, 0, 1000);    // Move image left
			await image.TranslateTo (-100, -100, 1000); // Move image up
			await image.TranslateTo (100, 100, 2000);   // Move image diagonally down and right
			await image.TranslateTo (0, 100, 1000);     // Move image left
			await image.TranslateTo (0, 0, 1000);       // Move image up
	Composite Animations
		A composite animation is a combination of animations where two or more animations run simultaneously. 
		Composite animations can be created by mixing awaited and non-awaited animations
		ex - Image is scaled and simultaneously rotated over 4 seconds
			image.RotateTo (360, 4000);
			await image.ScaleTo (2, 2000);
			await image.ScaleTo (1, 2000);
			
BOXVIEW
	BoxView renders a simple rectangle of a specified width, height, and color
	Typically you'll set the following properties of BoxView:
		Color to set its color.
		CornerRadius to set its corner radius.
		WidthRequest to set the width of the BoxView in device-independent units.
		HeightRequest to set the height of the BoxView.
	WidthRequest and HeightRequest only play role if BoxView is unconstrained in layout. This is the case when layout container needs to know child's size
	WidthRequest and HeightRequest are ignored if BoxView is constrained in layout, in which case the layout container imposes its own size on BoxView.
	
BUTTON
	Button implements the IFontElement interface, so it includes FontFamily, FontSize, and FontAttributes properties.
	Using the command interface
		It is possible for an application to respond to Button taps without handling the Clicked event. 
		The Button implements an alternative notification mechanism called the command or commanding interface. This consists of two properties:
			Command of type ICommand
			CommandParameter property of type Object

	Page Navigation
		Calls to the OnDisappearing and OnAppearing overrides cannot be treated as guaranteed indications of page navigation. 
		For example, on iOS, the OnDisappearing override is called on the active page when the application terminates.
	
APP CLASS
	The Application class is the starting point for Xamarin.Forms
	The Application class offers the following features, which are exposed in your projects default App subclass
		A MainPage property, which is where to set the initial page for the app.
		A persistent Properties dictionary to store simple values across lifecycle state changes.
		Lifecycle methods OnStart, OnSleep, and OnResume.
		Page navigation events PageAppearing, PageDisappearing.
		Modal navigation events ModalPushing, ModalPushed, ModalPopping, and ModalPopped.
	MainPage Property
		The MainPage property on the Application class sets the root page of the application.
	Properties Dictionary
		This can be accessed from anywhere in your Xamarin.Forms code using Application.Current.Properties.
		The Properties dictionary uses a string key and stores an object value.
		Data added to the dictionary will be available when the application returns from the background or even after it is restarted.
		Note - dictionary can only serialize primitive types for storage. Attempting to store other types (such as List<string>) can fail silently.
	Lifecycle Methods
		OnStart - Called when the application starts.
		OnSleep - Called each time the application goes to the background.
		OnResume - Called when the application is resumed, after being sent to the background.
		There is no method for application termination
		Normally (i.e. not a crash) application terminate from the OnSleep state, without any additional notifications to your code.
	Page Navigation events
		PageAppearing - raised when a page is about to appear on the screen.
		PageDisappearing - raised when a page is about to disappear from the screen.
	Modal Navigation Events - let you respond to modal pages being shown and dismissed
		ModalPushing - ModalPushingEventArgs
		ModalPushed - ModalPushedEventArgs
		ModalPopping - the ModalPoppingEventArgs class contains a Cancel property. When Cancel is set to true the modal pop is cancelled.
		ModalPopped - ModalPoppedEventArgs
		
BEHAVIORS
	Behaviors enable you to implement code that you would normally have to write as code-behind
	In the context of commanding, behaviors are a useful approach for connecting a control to a command
	Every Xamarin.Forms control has a Behaviors collection, to which one or more behaviors can be added
	Note - behaviors are not implicitly removed from controls when page disappears. Behaviors must be explicitly removed prior to pages going out of scope.
	Xamarin.Forms supports two different styles of behaviors
		Xamarin.Forms behaviors – 
			classes that derive from the Behavior or Behavior<T> class, where T is the type of the control to which the behavior should apply.
			Steps to define behaviors inside control in XAML -
				Create a class that inherits from the Behavior or Behavior<T> class.
				Override the OnAttachedTo method to perform any required setup.
				Override the OnDetachingFrom method to perform any required cleanup.
				Implement the core functionality of the behavior.
			override void OnAttachedTo (View bindable)
				It is fired immediately after the behavior is attached to a control
				Receives a reference to the control to which it is attached
				Can be used to register event handlers or perform other setup that's required to support the behavior functionality.
			override void OnDetachingFrom (View bindable)
				It is fired when the behavior is removed from the control
				It is used to perform any required cleanup.ex - unsubscribing from an event on a control to prevent memory leaks.
			ex - application which highlights the value entered by the user into an Entry control in red, if it's not a double.
				C# Page -
					//The core functionality of the behavior is provided by the OnEntryTextChanged method
					public class NumericValidationBehavior : Behavior<Entry>
					{
						protected override void OnAttachedTo(Entry entry)  //registers an event handler for the TextChanged event
						{
							entry.TextChanged += OnEntryTextChanged;
							base.OnAttachedTo(entry);
						}
						protected override void OnDetachingFrom(Entry entry)  //de-registering the TextChanged event to prevent memory leaks
						{
							entry.TextChanged -= OnEntryTextChanged;
							base.OnDetachingFrom(entry);
						}
						void OnEntryTextChanged(object sender, TextChangedEventArgs args)
						{
							double result;
							bool isValid = double.TryParse (args.NewTextValue, out result);
							((Entry)sender).TextColor = isValid ? Color.Default : Color.Red;
						}
					}
				XAML Page -
					<Entry Placeholder="Enter a System.Double">
						<Entry.Behaviors>
							<local:NumericValidationBehavior />
						</Entry.Behaviors>
					</Entry>
			Consuming a Xamarin.Forms Behavior with a Style
				Creating a style that sets the Behaviors property of a control is not possible because the property is read-only. 
				The solution is to add an attached property to the behavior class that controls adding and removing the behavior. 
				Ensure that the attached property registers a propertyChanged delegate that will be executed when the value of the property changes.
			ex - shows an attached property that controls adding and removing the NumericValidationBehavior
				C# Page -
					public class NumericValidationBehavior : Behavior<Entry>
					{
						public static readonly BindableProperty AttachBehaviorProperty =
							BindableProperty.CreateAttached ("AttachBehavior", 
								typeof(bool), 
								typeof(NumericValidationBehavior), 
								false, 
								propertyChanged: OnAttachBehaviorChanged);
						public static bool GetAttachBehavior (BindableObject view)
						{
							return (bool)view.GetValue (AttachBehaviorProperty);
						}
						public static void SetAttachBehavior (BindableObject view, bool value)
						{
							view.SetValue (AttachBehaviorProperty, value);
						}
						static void OnAttachBehaviorChanged (BindableObject view, object oldValue, object newValue)
						{
							var entry = view as Entry;
							if (entry == null) { return; }
							bool attachBehavior = (bool)newValue;
							if (attachBehavior) {
								entry.Behaviors.Add(new NumericValidationBehavior());
							} 
							else {
								var toRemove = entry.Behaviors.FirstOrDefault (b => b is NumericValidationBehavior);
								if (toRemove != null) {
									entry.Behaviors.Remove(toRemove);
								}
							}
						}
						...  //override OnAttachedTo() and OnDetachingFrom() 
					}
				XAML File -
					<Style x:Key="NumericValidationStyle" TargetType="Entry">
						<Style.Setters>
							<Setter Property="local:NumericValidationBehavior.AttachBehavior" Value="true" />
						</Style.Setters>
					</Style>
					...
					<Entry Placeholder="Enter a System.Double" Style="{StaticResource NumericValidationStyle}">
		Attached behaviors
			An issue with attached behaviors is that they are defined in a static class, with static properties and methods. 
			This makes it difficult to create attached behaviors that have state. 
			In addition, Xamarin.Forms behaviors have replaced attached behaviors as the preferred approach to behavior construction.
			ex
				C# Page -
					public static class NumericValidationBehavior
					{
						public static readonly BindableProperty AttachBehaviorProperty =
							BindableProperty.CreateAttached ("AttachBehavior",
								typeof(bool),
								typeof(NumericValidationBehavior),
								false,
								propertyChanged:OnAttachBehaviorChanged);
						public static bool GetAttachBehavior (BindableObject view)
						{
							return (bool)view.GetValue (AttachBehaviorProperty);
						}
						public static void SetAttachBehavior (BindableObject view, bool value)
						{
							view.SetValue (AttachBehaviorProperty, value);
						}
						static void OnAttachBehaviorChanged (BindableObject view, object oldValue, object newValue)
						{
							var entry = view as Entry;
							if (entry == null) { return; }
							bool attachBehavior = (bool)newValue;
							if (attachBehavior) {
								entry.TextChanged += OnEntryTextChanged;
							} 
							else {
								entry.TextChanged -= OnEntryTextChanged;
							}
						}
						static void OnEntryTextChanged (object sender, TextChangedEventArgs args)
						{
							double result;
							bool isValid = double.TryParse (args.NewTextValue, out result);
							((Entry)sender).TextColor = isValid ? Color.Default : Color.Red;
						}
					}

CUSTOM RENDERERS
	Custom Renderers let developers customize the appearance and behavior of Xamarin.Forms controls on each platform.
	Implementing custom renderer class is often heavy-weight response. Effects simplify this process, and are typically used for small styling changes.
	For most Xamarin.Forms elements, it is optional to provide a custom renderer in each platform project.
	However, custom renderers are required in each platform project when rendering a View or ViewCell element.
	If a custom renderer isn't registered, then the default renderer for the control's base class will be used.
	without using a custom renderer - 
		C# Page - create a custom control through subclass
			public class MyEntry : Entry  //the MyEntry control is an Entry control where the BackgroundColor is set to gray
			{
				public MyEntry ()
				{
					BackgroundColor = Color.Gray;
				}
			}
		XAML Page - consume the custom control in place of the original control. 
			<ContentPage
				...
				xmlns:local="clr-namespace:CustomRenderer;assembly=CustomRenderer"
				...>
				...
				<local:MyEntry Text="In Shared Code" />
				...
			</ContentPage>
	Renderer Base Classes and Native Controls
		Every Xamarin.Forms control has an accompanying renderer for each platform that creates an instance of a native control
		https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/app-fundamentals/custom-renderer/renderers
	Steps to create custom renderer - 
		Create an empty (no implementation) Xamarin.Forms custom control. Customization of the control will be carried out in the custom renderer
		Consume the custom control in XAML in Xamarin.Forms.
		Create the custom renderer for the control on each platform.
			Create a subclass of the corresponding Renderer class that renders the native control.
			Override OnElementChanged() and write logic to customize the control. It is called when the corresponding Xamarin.Forms control is created.
			Add ExportRenderer attribute to the custom renderer class to register the custom renderer with Xamarin.Forms.
	ex - implement an Entry control that has a different background color on each platform.
		Xamarin.Forms C# Page -
			public class MyEntry : Entry {}
		Xamarin.Forms XAML Page -
			<ContentPage ...
				xmlns:local="clr-namespace:CustomRenderer;assembly=CustomRenderer"
				...>
				...
				<local:MyEntry Text="In Shared Code" />
				...
			</ContentPage>
		Creating the Custom Renderer on iOS
			using Xamarin.Forms.Platform.iOS;
			[assembly: ExportRenderer (typeof(MyEntry), typeof(MyEntryRenderer))]
			namespace CustomRenderer.iOS
			{
				public class MyEntryRenderer : EntryRenderer
				{
					protected override void OnElementChanged (ElementChangedEventArgs<Entry> e)  //renders the native control
					{
						base.OnElementChanged (e);  //instantiates an iOS UITextField control, whose reference is assigned to the Control property.
						if (Control != null) {  //do whatever you want to the UITextField here!
							Control.BackgroundColor = UIColor.FromRGB (204, 153, 255);
							Control.BorderStyle = UITextBorderStyle.Line;
						}
					}
				}
			}
		Creating the Custom Renderer on Android
			using Xamarin.Forms.Platform.Android;
			[assembly: ExportRenderer(typeof(MyEntry), typeof(MyEntryRenderer))]
			namespace CustomRenderer.Android
			{
				class MyEntryRenderer : EntryRenderer
				{
					protected override void OnElementChanged(ElementChangedEventArgs<Entry> e)  //renders the native control
					{
						base.OnElementChanged(e);  //instantiates an Android EditText control, whose reference is assigned to the Control property.
						if (Control != null)
						{
							Control.SetBackgroundColor(global::Android.Graphics.Color.LightGreen);
						}
					}
				}
			}
		Creating the Custom Renderer on UWP
			[assembly: ExportRenderer(typeof(MyEntry), typeof(MyEntryRenderer))]
			namespace CustomRenderer.UWP
			{
				public class MyEntryRenderer : EntryRenderer
				{
					protected override void OnElementChanged(ElementChangedEventArgs<Entry> e)  //renders the native control
					{
						base.OnElementChanged(e);  //instantiates an UMP TextBox control, whose reference is assigned to the Control property.
						if (Control != null)
						{
							Control.Background = new SolidColorBrush(Colors.Cyan);
						}
					}
				}
			}

DATA BINDING
	A Xamarin.Forms data binding links a pair of properties between two objects, at least one of which is usually a user-interface object
	Note - target is always the object on which the data binding is set even if it's providing data rather than receiving data.
	To set the data binding, use the following two members of the target class (target class should derive from BindableObject) -
		The BindingContext property specifies the source object.
		The SetBinding method specifies the target property and source property.
	Bindings with a Binding Context
		XAML -
			<StackLayout Padding="10, 0">
				<Label Text="TEXT" BindingContext="{x:Reference Name=slider}" Rotation="{Binding Path=Value}" />  // Name and Path can be skipped
				<Slider x:Name="slider" />
			</StackLayout>
		Same can be achieved in C# code -
			label.BindingContext = slider;  //BindingContext property indicates the binding source, which is the Slider.
			label.SetBinding(Label.RotationProperty, "Value");  //specifies both the target property (BindableProperty) and the source property (string). 
	Bindings without a Binding Context
		The BindingContext property is an important component of data bindings, but it is not always necessary. 
		The source object can instead be specified in the SetBinding call or the Binding markup extension.
		XAML -
			<StackLayout Padding="10, 0">
				<Label Text="TEXT" Scale="{Binding Source={x:Reference Name=slider}, Path=Value}" />  // To skip Path, make it the first property
				<Slider x:Name="slider" />
			</StackLayout>
		other uncommon way (but sometimes it's necessary when complex objects are involved.) -
			<Label Text="TEXT">
				<Label.Scale>
					<Binding Path="Value">
						<Binding.Source>
							<x:Reference Name="slider" />
						</Binding.Source>
					</Binding>
				</Label.Scale>
			</Label>
		Same can be achieved in C# code -
			label.SetBinding(Label.ScaleProperty, new Binding("Value", source: slider));
	Binding Context Inheritance
		you can specify the source object using the BindingContext property or the Source property of the Binding object. 
		If both are set, the Source property of the Binding takes precedence over the BindingContext.
		The setting of the BindingContext property is inherited through the visual tree.
		XAML -
			<StackLayout Padding="10">
				<StackLayout VerticalOptions="FillAndExpand" BindingContext="{x:Reference slider}">
					<Label Text="TEXT" Rotation="{Binding Value}" />
					<BoxView Color="BLUE" HorizontalOptions="Center" VerticalOptions="Center" Rotation="{Binding Value}" />
				</StackLayout>
				<Slider x:Name="slider" Maximum="360" />
			</StackLayout>
	binding mode for every bindable property -
		Default
		TwoWay – data goes both ways between source and target (Value property of Slider, Text property of Editor, Entry, SearchBar, and EntryCell)
		OneWay – data goes from source to target. (Rotation, Scale, Opacity)
		OneWayToSource – data goes from target to source (SelectedItem property of ListView)
		OneTime – data goes from source to target, but only when the BindingContext changes (IsTextPredictionEnabled property of Entry)
	ViewModels and Property-Change Notifications
		ViewModel is the data-binding source.
		It implements a notification mechanism that allows the binding infrastructure to be notified when the value of a property changes. 
		This notification mechanism is the INotifyPropertyChanged interface, which defines a single property named PropertyChanged. 
		INotifyPropertyChanged interface is also implemented by BindableObject and PropertyChanged event is fired whenever bindable property changes value
		ex -
			C# page -
				//The HslColorViewModel class defines five properties: The Hue, Saturation, Luminosity, and Color properties are interrelated. 
				//When any one of the three color components changes value, the Color property is recalculated, and PropertyChanged events are fired
				public class HslColorViewModel : INotifyPropertyChanged
				{
					Color color;
					string name;
					public event PropertyChangedEventHandler PropertyChanged;
					public double Hue
					{
						set
						{
							if (color.Hue != value){ Color = Color.FromHsla(value, color.Saturation, color.Luminosity); }
						}
						get{ return color.Hue; }
					}
					public double Saturation
					{
						set
						{
							if (color.Saturation != value){ Color = Color.FromHsla(color.Hue, value, color.Luminosity); }
						}
						get{ return color.Saturation; }
					}
					public double Luminosity
					{
						set
						{
							if (color.Luminosity != value){ Color = Color.FromHsla(color.Hue, color.Saturation, value); }
						}
						get{ return color.Luminosity; }
					}
					public Color Color
					{
						set
						{
							if (color != value)
							{
								color = value;
								PropertyChanged?.Invoke(this, new PropertyChangedEventArgs("Hue"));
								PropertyChanged?.Invoke(this, new PropertyChangedEventArgs("Saturation"));
								PropertyChanged?.Invoke(this, new PropertyChangedEventArgs("Luminosity"));
								PropertyChanged?.Invoke(this, new PropertyChangedEventArgs("Color"));
								Name = NamedColor.GetNearestColorName(color);
							}
						}
						get{ return color; }
					}
					public string Name
					{
						private set
						{
							if (name != value)
							{
								name = value;
								PropertyChanged?.Invoke(this, new PropertyChangedEventArgs("Name"));
							}
						}
						get{ return name; }
					}
				}
			XAML page -
				//When a ViewModel is set as a binding source, the binding infrastructure attaches a handler to the PropertyChanged event. 
				//In this way, Binding Extension can be notified of changes to the properties, and can then set the target properties from the changed values.
				//Value property of Slider is TwoWay. This allows each Slider to be set from ViewModel, and also for ViewModel to be set from each Slider.
				//When the program is first run, the BoxView, Label, and three Slider elements are all set from the ViewModel based on the initial Color.

	Overriding the Binding Mode	
		setting the Mode property to TwoWay doesn't always work as you might expect
	String Formatting
		Formating Types in .NET - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/formatting-types
		XAML -
			<Slider x:Name="slider" />
			<Label Text="{Binding Source={x:Reference slider}, Path=Value, StringFormat='The slider value is {0:F2}'}" />
	Binding Path
		It's actually possible to set Path to a sub-property (a property of a property), or to a member of a collection.
		If a property in the binding path does not implement INotifyPropertyChanged, any changes to that property will be ignored
		XAML -
			<ContentPage ... xmlns:globe="clr-namespace:System.Globalization;assembly=mscorlib" x:Name="page">
				<StackLayout Margin="10, 0">
					<TimePicker x:Name="timePicker" />
					<Label Text="{Binding Source={x:Reference timePicker}, Path=Time.TotalSeconds, StringFormat='{0} total seconds'}" />
					<Label Text="{Binding Source={x:Reference page}, Path=Content.Children.Count, StringFormat='There are {0} children in this StackLayout'}" />
					<Label Text="{Binding 
						Source={x:Static globe:CultureInfo.CurrentCulture}, 
						Path=DateTimeFormat.DayNames[3], 
						StringFormat='The middle day of the week is {0}'}" />
					<Label>
						<Label.Text>
							<Binding Path="DateTimeFormat.DayNames[3]" StringFormat="The middle day of the week in France is {0}">
								<Binding.Source>
									<globe:CultureInfo>
										<x:Arguments>
											<x:String>fr-FR</x:String>
										</x:Arguments>
									</globe:CultureInfo>
								</Binding.Source>
							</Binding>
						</Label.Text>
					</Label>
					<Label Text="{Binding 
						Source={x:Reference page}, 
						Path=Content.Children[1].Text.Length, 
						StringFormat='The second Label has {0} characters'}" />
				</StackLayout>
			</ContentPage>
	Binding Value Converters
		For explicit types conversions, you need to implement the IValueConverter interface.
		The Convert method is called when data moves from the source to the target in OneWay or TwoWay bindings.
		The ConvertBack method is called when data moves from the target to the source in TwoWay or OneWayToSource bindings.
		If the data binding also includes a StringFormat setting, the value converter is invoked before the result is formatted as a string.
		example
			C# file -
				public class IntToBoolConverter : IValueConverter
				{
					public object Convert(object value, Type targetType, object parameter, CultureInfo culture)
					{
						return (int)value != 0;
					}
					public object ConvertBack(object value, Type targetType, object parameter, CultureInfo culture)
					{
						return (bool)value ? 1 : 0;
					}
				}
			XAML Snippet -
				<ContentPage.Resources>
					<ResourceDictionary>
						<local:IntToBoolConverter x:Key="intToBool" />
					</ResourceDictionary>
				</ContentPage.Resources>
				......
				<Entry x:Name="entry" Text="" Placeholder="enter search term" VerticalOptions="CenterAndExpand" />
				<Button Text="Search" IsEnabled="{Binding Source={x:Reference entry}, Path=Text.Length, Converter={StaticResource intToBool}}" />
		Binding Converter Properties
			Value converter classes can have properties and generic parameters
			example - This particular value converter converts a bool from the source to an object of type T for the target:
				C# file -
					public class BoolToObjectConverter<T> : IValueConverter
					{
						public T TrueObject { set; get; }
						public T FalseObject { set; get; }
						public object Convert(object value, Type targetType, object parameter, CultureInfo culture)
						{
							return (bool)value ? TrueObject : FalseObject;
						}
						public object ConvertBack(object value, Type targetType, object parameter, CultureInfo culture)
						{
							return ((T)value).Equals(TrueObject);
						}
					}
				XAML file -
					//Although it's common to instantiate value converters as resources in a resource dictionary
					//this page demonstrates an alternative: Each value converter is instantiated between Binding.Converter property-element tags. 
					//The x:TypeArguments indicates the generic argument, and TrueObject and FalseObject are both set to objects of that type
					<Switch x:Name="switch1" />
					<Label>
						<Label.Text>
							<Binding Source="{x:Reference switch1}" Path="IsToggled">
								<Binding.Converter>
									<local:BoolToObjectConverter x:TypeArguments="x:String" TrueObject="Of course!" FalseObject="No way!" />
								</Binding.Converter>
							</Binding>
						</Label.Text>
					</Label>
					<Switch x:Name="switch2" />
					<Label FontSize="18" VerticalOptions="Center">

		Binding Converter Parameters
			If ConverterParameter property is set, then the value is passed to the Convert and ConvertBack methods as the parameter argument
			example
				{Binding Red, Converter={StaticResource doubleToInt}, ConverterParameter=255, StringFormat='Red = {0:X2}'}
				//or
				<Binding.ConverterParameter>
					<x:Double>255</x:Double>
				</Binding.ConverterParameter>
	Binding Fallbacks
		Sometimes data bindings fail, because the binding source can't be resolved, or because the binding succeeds but returns a null value
		Binding failure can be handled by defining the FallbackValue and TargetNullValue properties
		The FallbackValue property allows a fallback value to be defined that will be used when the binding source can't be resolved.
			<Label Text="{Binding Population, FallbackValue='Population size unknown'}"/>  //value is delimited by single-quote characters.
			//or
			<Label Text="{Binding Population, FallbackValue={StaticResource populationUnknown}}"/>  //recommended to define as resources in ResourceDictionary
		The TargetNullValue property allows a replacement value to be defined that will be used when the binding source is resolved, but the value is null.
	Compiled Bindings
		Compiled bindings improve data binding performance by resolving binding expressions at compile-time rather than runtime
		Process for using compiled bindings -
			Enable XAML compilation.
			Set an x:DataType attribute on a VisualElement to the type of the object that the VisualElement and its children will bind to.
		
ICOMMAND INTERFACE
	In MVVM, data bindings are defined between ViewModel's properties (which implements INotifyPropertyChanged) and View's properties (XAML file)
	The commanding interface provides an approach to implementing commands (user interaction) that is much better suited to the MVVM architecture
	To allow a data binding between a Button and a ViewModel -
		define a data binding where the source is ViewModel's property of type ICommand and the target is the Button's Command property
		The ViewModel contains code associated with that ICommand property that is executed when the button is clicked
		Set CommandParameter to arbitrary data to distinguish between multiple buttons if they are all bound to the same ICommand property
	The Command and CommandParameter properties are also defined by the following classes:
		MenuItem and hence, ToolbarItem, which derives from MenuItem
		TextCell and hence, ImageCell, which derives from TextCell
		TapGestureRecognizer
		SearchBar defines a SearchCommand property of type ICommand and a SearchCommandParameter property. 
		ListView defines a RefreshCommand property of type ICommand.
	ICommand consists of two methods and one event - 
		public void Execute (Object parameter);  //called when a command is performed. Ex - When a button is pressed
		public bool CanExecute (Object parameter);  //firstly called when the binding is first defined. If this returns false, then Button disables itself.
		public event EventHandler CanExecuteChanged;  //When that event is fired, the Button calls CanExecute again. THis is fired from within ViewModel
	Using Command Parameters
		When working with CommandParameter, use the generic Command<T> class to specify the type of the object set to CommandParameter. 
		The execute and canExecute methods that you specify have parameters of that type.
	Adding Commands to Existing Views
		use a Xamarin.Forms behavior that converts an event into a command.
	Asynchronous Commanding for Navigation Menus
		it's possible to use a Xamarin.Forms behavior that converts an event into a command
	
DEPENDENCY SERVICE
EFFECTS	
FILE HANDLING
	Saving and Loading Files
		The System.IO classes can be used to access the file system on each platform. 
		The File class lets you create, delete, and read files.
		Directory class allows you to create, delete, or enumerate the contents of directories. 
		You can also use Stream subclasses, which provide greater degree of control over file operations (such as compression or position search within file)
		Path of the file can be determined using Environment.SpecialFolder enumeration as the first argument to the Environment.GetFolderPath method.
	Loading Files Embedded as Resources
		To embed a file into a .NET Standard assembly, create or add a file and ensure 'Build Action: EmbeddedResource' in properties context menu
		GetManifestResourceStream is used to access the embedded file using its Resource ID (By default, resourceID=namespace+filename with ext.)
		ex - shows an XML file being loaded and deserialized from a resource, then bound to a ListView for display
			var assembly = IntrospectionExtensions.GetTypeInfo(typeof(LoadResourceText)).Assembly;
			Stream stream = assembly.GetManifestResourceStream("WorkingWithFiles.PCLXmlResource.xml");
			List<Monkey> monkeys;
			using (var reader = new System.IO.StreamReader (stream)) 
			{
				var serializer = new XmlSerializer(typeof(List<Monkey>));
				monkeys = (List<Monkey>)serializer.Deserialize(reader);
			}
			var listView = new ListView ();
			listView.ItemsSource = monkeys;
			
GESTURES
	Gesture recognizers can be used to detect user interaction with views in a Xamarin.Forms application.
	GestureRecognizer class supports tap, pinch, pan, and swipe gestures on View instances.
	Tap
		The tap gesture is used for tap detection and is implemented with the TapGestureRecognizer class
		ex -
			var tapGestureRecognizer = new TapGestureRecognizer();  //create a TapGestureRecognizer instance
			tapGestureRecognizer.Tapped += (sender, eventArgs) => {
				//handle the Tapped event
			};
			tapGestureRecognizer.NumberOfTapsRequired = 2; //Set the NumberOfTapsRequired property to wait for a double-tap (or more taps if required)
			image.GestureRecognizers.Add(tapGestureRecognizer);  //add the instance to the GestureRecognizers collection on the user interface element
		A gesture recognizer can be added to a control in Xaml using attached properties.
			<Image Source="tapped.jpg">
				<Image.GestureRecognizers>
					<TapGestureRecognizer Tapped="OnTapGestureRecognizerTapped" NumberOfTapsRequired="2" />
				</Image.GestureRecognizers>
			</Image>
		Applications that use the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern typically use ICommand rather than wiring up event handlers directly
			C# snippet -
				var tapGestureRecognizer = new TapGestureRecognizer();
				tapGestureRecognizer.SetBinding (TapGestureRecognizer.CommandProperty, "TapCommand");
				image.GestureRecognizers.Add(tapGestureRecognizer);
			or XAML snippet -
				<Image Source="tapped.jpg">
					<Image.GestureRecognizers>
						<TapGestureRecognizer Command="{Binding TapCommand}" CommandParameter="Image1" />
					</Image.GestureRecognizers>
				</Image>
	Pinch
		The pinch gesture is used for performing interactive zoom and is implemented with the PinchGestureRecognizer class. 
		A common scenario for the pinch gesture is to perform interactive zoom of an image at the pinch location.
	Pan
		The pan gesture is used for detecting the movement of fingers around the screen and applying that movement to content
		ex - horizontally and vertically pan an image (whose dimensions are greater than mobile viewPort), so that all of the image content can be viewed
	Swipe
		A swipe gesture occurs when a finger is moved across the screen in horizontal or vertical direction
		It is often used to initiate navigation through content
		SwipeGestureRecognizer class has Direction property which can be set to multiple SwipeDirection enumeration values (Left, Right, Up, or Down)
		The SwipeGestureRecognizer class also includes a Threshold property
			Optionally set to a uint value that represents the minimum swipe distance that must be achieved for a swipe to be recognized.
			The default value of this property is 100, meaning that any swipes that are less than 100 device-independent units will be ignored.
		The SwipeGestureRecognizer class also includes Command and CommandParameter properties
			C# snippet -
				var boxView = new BoxView { Color = Color.Teal, ... };
				var leftSwipeGesture = new SwipeGestureRecognizer { Direction = SwipeDirection.Left, CommandParameter = "Left" };
				leftSwipeGesture.SetBinding(SwipeGestureRecognizer.CommandProperty, "SwipeCommand");
				boxView.GestureRecognizers.Add(leftSwipeGesture);
			or XAML snippet -
				<BoxView Color="Teal" ...>
					<BoxView.GestureRecognizers>
						<SwipeGestureRecognizer Direction="Left" Command="{Binding SwipeCommand}" CommandParameter="Left" />
					</BoxView.GestureRecognizers>
				</BoxView>
				
LOCAL DATABASES
	Applications can use the sqlite-net-pcl NuGet package to incorporate database operations by referencing the SQLite classes
	
MESSAGING CENTER
	MessagingCenter enables view models and other components to communicate with a mere knowledge of a simple Message contract.
	There are two parts to MessagingCenter - 
		Subscribe - Listen for messages with a certain signature and perform some action when they are received.
		Send - Publish a message for listeners to act upon. If no listeners have subscribed then the message is ignored.
	API for MessagingCenter is simple -
		Subscribe<TSender> (object subscriber, string message, Action<TSender> callback, TSender source = null)
		Send<TSender> (TSender sender, string message)
		Unsubscribe<TSender> (object subscriber, string message)
		Subscribe<TSender, TArgs> (object subscriber, string message, Action<TSender, TArgs> callback, TSender source = null)		
		Send<TSender, TArgs> (TSender sender, string message, TArgs args)
		Unsubscribe<TSender, TArgs> (object subscriber, string message)
		
NAVIGATION
	Hierarchical Navigation
		To move from one page to another, an application will push a new page onto the navigation stack, where it will become the active page
		To return back to the previous page, application will pop the current page from the navigation stack, and the new topmost page becomes the active page
		NavigationPage has a navigation bar which displays a title, an icon, and a Back button that returns to the previous page 
		NOTE - It's recommended that a NavigationPage should be populated with ContentPage instances only.
		The first page added to a navigation stack is referred to as the root page of the application
			public App () { MainPage = new NavigationPage (new Page1Xaml()); }
			This causes Page1Xaml to be pushed onto the navigation stack, where it becomes the active page and the root page of the application
		Pushing Pages to the Navigation Stack - await Navigation.PushAsync(new Page2Xaml());
		Popping Pages from the Navigation Stack - await Navigation.PopAsync();
		Pops all but the root Page off the navigation stack - await Navigation.PopToRootAsync();
		Passing Data when Navigating
			passing data through a page constructor
			setting the new page's BindingContext to the data - RECOMMENDED
				async void OnNavigateButtonClicked (object sender, EventArgs e)
				{
					var contact = new Contact {Name = "Jane Doe",Age = 30,Occupation = "Developer",Country = "USA"};
					var secondPage = new SecondPage ();
					secondPage.BindingContext = contact;
					await Navigation.PushAsync (secondPage);
				}
		Manipulating the Navigation Stack
			InsertPageBefore (Xamarin.Forms.Page page, Xamarin.Forms.Page before) - Inserts a page in the navigation stack before an existing page in the stack
				async void OnLoginButtonClicked (object sender, EventArgs e)
				{
					...
					var isValid = AreCredentialsCorrect (user);
					if (isValid) {
						App.IsUserLoggedIn = true;
						Navigation.InsertPageBefore (new MainPage (), this);  //MainPage instance is inserted into navigation stack before current page
						await Navigation.PopAsync ();  //removes current page from navigation stack, with MainPage instance becoming the active page.
					} else {// Login failed}
				}
			RemovePage (Xamarin.Forms.Page page) - Removes the specified page from the navigation stack
		Displaying Views in the Navigation Bar
			Any Xamarin.Forms View can be displayed in the navigation bar of a NavigationPage by setting the NavigationPage.TitleView attached property
				<NavigationPage.TitleView>
					<Slider HeightRequest="44" WidthRequest="300" />
				</NavigationPage.TitleView>
	Tabbed Page
		NOTE - It's recommended that a TabbedPage should be populated with NavigationPage and ContentPageinstances only
		ex - TabbedPage is populated with two child Page objects - ContentPage instance and NavigationPage containing a ContentPage instance.
			<TabbedPage	xmlns:local="clr-namespace:TabbedPageWithNavigationPage" x:Class="TabbedPageWithNavigationPage.MainPage">
				<local:TodayPage />
				<NavigationPage Title="Schedule" Icon="schedule.png">
					<x:Arguments>
						<local:SchedulePage />
					</x:Arguments>
				</NavigationPage>
			</TabbedPage>
	Carousel Page
		NOTE - A CarouselPage can only be populated with ContentPage instances, or ContentPage derivatives.
		If CarouselPage is embedded into Detail page of MasterDetailPage, then have MasterDetailPage.IsGestureEnabled=false to prevent gesture conflicts
	Master-Detail Page
		It manages two related pages of information – a master page that presents items, and a detail page that presents details about items on the master page
		MasterDetailPage is designed to be a root page, and using it as a child page in other page types could result in unexpected and inconsistent behavior.
		NOTE - master page of a MasterDetailPage should always be a ContentPage instance
		NOTE - detail page should only be populated with TabbedPage, NavigationPage, and ContentPage instances
		The MasterDetailPage.Master page must have its Title property set, or an exception will occur.
		The detail page is presented to the user by setting the MasterDetailPage.IsPresented property to false
		MasterBehavior property determines how the detail page will be displayed -
			Default – The pages are displayed using the platform default.
			Popover – The detail page covers, or partially covers the master page.
			Split – The master page is displayed on the left and the detail page is on the right.
			SplitOnLandscape – A split screen is used when the device is in landscape orientation.
			SplitOnPortrait – A split screen is used when the device is in portrait orientation.
				
	Modal Page
		A modal page encourages users to complete a self-contained task that cannot be navigated away from until the task is completed or cancelled
		A modal page can be any of the Page types supported by Xamarin.Forms
		To display a modal page the application will push it onto the modal stack, where it will become the active page
		To return to the previous page the application will pop the current page from the modal stack, and the new topmost page becomes the active page
		There is no concept of performing modal stack manipulation because these operations are not universally supported
		NOTE - A NavigationPage instance is not required for performing modal page navigation.
		Pushing Pages to the Modal Stack - await Navigation.PushModalAsync (detailPage);
		Application can disable the Back button for the modal page by overriding the Page.OnBackButtonPressed method on the modal page
	Displaying Pop-ups
		Xamarin.Forms provides two pop-up-like user interface elements – an alert and an action sheet
		Displaying an Alert - 
			DisplayAlert("Alert", "You have been alerted", "OK");
			bool answer = await DisplayAlert("Question?", "Would you like to play a game", "Yes", "No");
		Displaying an Action Sheet -
			string action = DisplayActionSheet (string title, string cancel, string destruction, params string[] buttons);
				cancel - Can be null to hide the cancel action
				destruction - Can be null to hide the destructive option.
				
CONTROL TEMPLATES
	Control templates provide a clean separation between the appearance of a page and its content
	Themes provided by control templates aren't limited to changing the properties of controls. They can also change the controls used to implement the theme.
	The page or view that consumes the ControlTemplate define content to be displayed by the ContentPresenter
	A ControlTemplate can be applied to the following types by setting their ControlTemplate properties -
		ContentPage
		ContentView
		TemplatedPage - It is the base class for ContentPage. Unlike ContentPage, TemplatedPage does not have a Content property.
		TemplatedView - It is the base class for ContentView. Unlike ContentView, TemplatedView does not have a Content property.
	Control templates can also be applied by using styles to further expand theme ability.
	Creating a ControlTemplate in XAML - Control templates can be defined at the application level or page level
		<Application ... x:Class="SimpleTheme.App">
			<Application.Resources>
				<ResourceDictionary>
					<ControlTemplate x:Key="TealTemplate">
						<Grid>
							...
							<BoxView ... />
							<Label Text="Control Template Demo App" TextColor="White" VerticalOptions="Center" ... />
							<ContentPresenter ... />
							<BoxView Color="Teal" ... />
							<Label Text="(c) Xamarin 2016" TextColor="White" VerticalOptions="Center" ... />
						</Grid>
					</ControlTemplate>
					<ControlTemplate x:Key="AquaTemplate">
					...
					</ControlTemplate>
				</ResourceDictionary>
			</Application.Resources>
		</Application>
	The following code example shows a ContentPage applying the TealTemplate to the ContentView -
		//The TealTemplate is assigned to the ContentView.ControlTemplate property by using the StaticResource markup extension
		//The ContentView.Content property is set to a StackLayout that defines the content to be displayed on the ContentPage. 
		//This content will be displayed by the ContentPresenter contained in the TealTemplate.
		<ContentPage ... x:Class="SimpleTheme.HomePage">
			<ContentView x:Name="contentView" Padding="0,20,0,0" ControlTemplate="{StaticResource TealTemplate}">
				<StackLayout VerticalOptions="CenterAndExpand">
					<Label Text="Welcome to the app!" HorizontalOptions="Center" />
					<Button Text="Change Theme" Clicked="OnButtonClicked" />
				</StackLayout>
			</ContentView>
		</ContentPage>
	Setting a ControlTemplate with a Style
		<Style TargetType="ContentView">
			<Setter Property="ControlTemplate" Value="{StaticResource TealTemplate}" />
		</Style>
	Re-theming an Application at Runtime
		void OnButtonClicked(object sender, EventArgs e) {
			originalTemplate = !originalTemplate;
			contentView.ControlTemplate = (originalTemplate) ? tealTemplate : aquaTemplate;
		}
	Creating a ControlTemplate in C#
		class TealTemplate : Grid
		{
			public TealTemplate ()
			{
				...
				var contentPresenter = new ContentPresenter ();
				Children.Add (contentPresenter, 0, 1);
				Grid.SetColumnSpan (contentPresenter, 2);
				...
			}
		}
	Applying the TealTemplate to the ContentView in C#
		public class HomePageCS : ContentPage
		{
			ControlTemplate tealTemplate = new ControlTemplate (typeof(TealTemplate));
			ControlTemplate aquaTemplate = new ControlTemplate (typeof(AquaTemplate));
			public HomePageCS ()
			{
				var contentView = new ContentView {
					Padding = new Thickness (0, 20, 0, 0),
					Content = new StackLayout {
						VerticalOptions = LayoutOptions.CenterAndExpand,
						Children = {
							new Label { Text = "Welcome to the app!", HorizontalOptions = LayoutOptions.Center },
							new Button { Text = "Change Theme" }
							}
					},
					ControlTemplate = tealTemplate
				};
				Content = contentView;
			}
		}
	Template Binding
		Allow controls in a control template to data bind to bindable properties of the parent of the target view that owns the ControlTemplate. 
		TemplateBinding is only supported in the ControlTemplate
		Creating a TemplateBinding in XAML
			<ControlTemplate x:Key="TealTemplate">
				<Grid>
					...
					<Label Text="{TemplateBinding Parent.HeaderText}" ... />
					...
					<Label Text="{TemplateBinding Parent.FooterText}" ... />
				</Grid>
			</ControlTemplate>
		Here the bindable properties are defined on the grandparent(ContentPage) of the target view, rather than the parent(ContentView)
			<ContentPage ...>
				<ContentView ... ControlTemplate="{StaticResource TealTemplate}">
					...
				</ContentView>
			</ContentPage>
		Bindable properties that are defined on the ContentPage
			public static readonly BindableProperty HeaderTextProperty =
				BindableProperty.Create ("HeaderText", typeof(string), typeof(HomePage), "Control Template Demo App");
			public static readonly BindableProperty FooterTextProperty =
				BindableProperty.Create ("FooterText", typeof(string), typeof(HomePage), "(c) Xamarin 2016");
			public string HeaderText {
				get { return (string)GetValue(HeaderTextProperty); }
			}
			public string FooterText {
				get { return (string)GetValue(FooterTextProperty); }
			}
		Binding a BindableProperty to a ViewModel Property
			HomePageViewModel.cs
				public class HomePageViewModel
				{
					public string HeaderText { get { return "Control Template Demo App"; } }
					public string FooterText { get { return "(c) Xamarin 2016"; } }
				}
			XAML file
				<ContentPage ... xmlns:local="clr-namespace:SimpleTheme" HeaderText="{Binding HeaderText}" FooterText="{Binding FooterText}">
					<ContentPage.BindingContext>
						<local:HomePageViewModel />
					</ContentPage.BindingContext>
					<ContentView ControlTemplate="{StaticResource TealTemplate}" ...>
						...
					</ContentView>
				</ContentPage>
				
DATA TEMPLATES
	A DataTemplate is used to specify the appearance of data, and typically uses data binding to display data
	A DataTemplate can be used as a value for the following properties - 
		ListView.HeaderTemplate
		ListView.FooterTemplate
		ListView.GroupHeaderTemplate
		ItemsView.ItemTemplate, which is inherited by ListView.
		MultiPage.ItemTemplate, which is inherited by CarouselPage, MasterDetailPage, and TabbedPage.
	Although the TableView makes use of Cell objects, it does not use a DataTemplate. This is because data bindings are always set directly on Cell objects.
	Appearance of the data for each cell in the ListView can be managed by setting the ListView.ItemTemplate property to a DataTemplate by -
		Creating an Inline DataTemplate.
		Creating a DataTemplate with a Type.
		Creating a DataTemplate as a Resource.
	Creating an Inline DataTemplate
		<ListView Margin="0,20,0,0">
			<ListView.ItemsSource>
				<x:Array Type="{x:Type local:Person}">
					<local:Person Name="Steve" Age="21" Location="USA" />
					<local:Person Name="John" Age="37" Location="UK" />
				</x:Array>
			</ListView.ItemsSource>
			<ListView.ItemTemplate>
				<DataTemplate>  // child of DataTemplate must be of, or derive from, type Cell. This example uses a ViewCell, which derives from Cell
					<ViewCell>
						<Grid>
							...
							<Label Text="{Binding Name}" FontAttributes="Bold" />
							<Label Grid.Column="1" Text="{Binding Age}" />
							<Label Grid.Column="2" Text="{Binding Location}" HorizontalTextAlignment="End" />
						</Grid>
					</ViewCell>
				</DataTemplate>
			</ListView.ItemTemplate>
		</ListView>
	Creating a DataTemplate with a Type
		The ListView.ItemTemplate property can also be set to a DataTemplate that's created from a cell type.
			<ListView.ItemTemplate>
                <DataTemplate>
                    <local:PersonCell />
                </DataTemplate>
            </ListView.ItemTemplate>
		PersonCell definition
			<ViewCell ... x:Class="DataTemplates.PersonCell">
				<Grid>
					...
					<Label Text="{Binding Name}" FontAttributes="Bold" />
					<Label Grid.Column="1" Text="{Binding Age}" />
					<Label Grid.Column="2" Text="{Binding Location}" HorizontalTextAlignment="End" />
				</Grid>
			</ViewCell>
	Creating a DataTemplate as a Resource
		<ContentPage ...>
			<ContentPage.Resources>
				<ResourceDictionary>
					<DataTemplate x:Key="personTemplate">
						<ViewCell>
							<Grid>
								...
							</Grid>
						</ViewCell>
					</DataTemplate>
				</ResourceDictionary>
			</ContentPage.Resources>
			<StackLayout Margin="20">
				...
				<ListView ItemTemplate="{StaticResource personTemplate}" Margin="0,20,0,0">
					<ListView.ItemsSource>
						<x:Array Type="{x:Type local:Person}">
							<local:Person Name="Steve" Age="21" Location="USA" />
							...
						</x:Array>
					</ListView.ItemsSource>
				</ListView>
			</StackLayout>
		</ContentPage>
	Data Template Selector 
		A DataTemplateSelector can be used to choose a DataTemplate at runtime based on the value of a data-bound property
		It's implemented by creating a class that inherits from DataTemplateSelector. The OnSelectTemplate method is then overridden -
			public class PersonDataTemplateSelector : DataTemplateSelector
			{
				public DataTemplate ValidTemplate { get; set; }
				public DataTemplate InvalidTemplate { get; set; }
				protected override DataTemplate OnSelectTemplate (object item, BindableObject container){
					return ((Person)item).DateOfBirth.Year >= 1980 ? ValidTemplate : InvalidTemplate;
				}
			}
		Consuming a DataTemplateSelector in XAML
			In XAML, the PersonDataTemplateSelector can be instantiated by declaring it as a resource
				<ContentPage ... xmlns:local="clr-namespace:Selector;assembly=Selector" x:Class="Selector.HomePage">
					<ContentPage.Resources>
						<ResourceDictionary>
							<DataTemplate x:Key="validPersonTemplate">
								<ViewCell>...</ViewCell>
							</DataTemplate>
							<DataTemplate x:Key="invalidPersonTemplate">
								<ViewCell>...</ViewCell>
							</DataTemplate>
							<local:PersonDataTemplateSelector x:Key="personDataTemplateSelector"
								ValidTemplate="{StaticResource validPersonTemplate}"
								InvalidTemplate="{StaticResource invalidPersonTemplate}" />
						</ResourceDictionary>
					</ContentPage.Resources>
					...
				</ContentPage>
			The PersonDataTemplateSelector instance is consumed by assigning it to the ListView.ItemTemplate property
				<ListView x:Name="listView" ItemTemplate="{StaticResource personDataTemplateSelector}" />
		
TRIGGERS
	There are four types of trigger -
		Property Trigger - occurs when a property on a control is set to a particular value.
			<Entry Placeholder="enter name">
				<Entry.Triggers>
					<Trigger TargetType="Entry" Property="IsFocused" Value="True">
						<Setter Property="BackgroundColor" Value="Yellow" />
					</Trigger>
				</Entry.Triggers>
			</Entry>
		Data Trigger - uses data binding to trigger based on the properties of another control.
			<Entry x:Name="entry" Text="" Placeholder="required field" />
			<Button x:Name="button" Text="Save" FontSize="Large" HorizontalOptions="Center">
				<Button.Triggers>
					<DataTrigger TargetType="Button" Binding="{Binding Source={x:Reference entry}, Path=Text.Length}" Value="0">
						<Setter Property="IsEnabled" Value="False" />
					</DataTrigger>
				</Button.Triggers>
			</Button>
		Event Trigger - occurs when an event occurs on the control.
			XAML file -
				<EventTrigger Event="Clicked"> 
					<local:NumericValidationTriggerAction /> 
				</EventTrigger>
			C# file -
				public class NumericValidationTriggerAction : TriggerAction<Entry>  //Implement the generic TriggerAction<T> class
				{
					protected override void Invoke (Entry entry)  //Override the Invoke method
					{
						double result;
						bool isValid = Double.TryParse (entry.Text, out result);
						entry.TextColor = isValid ? Color.Default : Color.Red;
					}
				}
			Be careful when sharing triggers in a ResourceDictionary -
				One instance will be shared among controls.
				So any state that is configured once will apply to them all.
		Multi Trigger - allows multiple trigger conditions to be set before an action occurs.
			<MultiTrigger TargetType="Button">
				<MultiTrigger.Conditions>
					<BindingCondition Binding="{Binding Source={x:Reference email}, Path=Text.Length}" Value="0" />
					<BindingCondition Binding="{Binding Source={x:Reference phone}, Path=Text.Length}" Value="0" />
					<PropertyCondition Property="Text" Value="OK" />
				</MultiTrigger.Conditions>
				<Setter Property="IsEnabled" Value="False" />
				<!-- multiple Setter elements are allowed -->
			</MultiTrigger>
	Applying a Trigger using a Style
		<ContentPage.Resources>
			<ResourceDictionary>
				<Style TargetType="Entry">
					<Style.Triggers>
						<Trigger TargetType="Entry" Property="IsFocused" Value="True">
							<Setter Property="BackgroundColor" Value="Yellow" />
						</Trigger>
					</Style.Triggers>
				</Style>
			</ResourceDictionary>
		</ContentPage.Resources>
	If you want a condition "where Text.Length > 0" (which this can't be expressed in XAML),use a class extending IValueConverter
		MultiTriggerConverter.cs
			public class MultiTriggerConverter : IValueConverter
			{
				public object Convert(object value, Type targetType, object parameter, CultureInfo culture)
				{
					return (int)value > 0;
				}
			}
		Add it to the page's resource dictionary (along with a custom xmlns:local namespace definition)
			<ResourceDictionary>
			   <local:MultiTriggerConverter x:Key="dataHasBeenEntered" />
			</ResourceDictionary>
		Use it in trigger
			<Button.Triggers>
				<MultiTrigger TargetType="Button">
					<MultiTrigger.Conditions>
						<BindingCondition Binding="{Binding Source=..., Path=..., Converter={StaticResource dataHasBeenEntered}}" Value="true" />
					...
					</MultiTrigger.Conditions>
				<Setter Property="IsEnabled" Value="True" />
				</MultiTrigger>
			</Button.Triggers>
	EnterActions and ExitActions
		Another way to implement changes when a trigger occurs is by adding EnterActions and ExitActions collections and implementing TriggerAction<T>.
		You can provide both EnterActions and ExitActions as well as Setters in a trigger
		Be aware that the Setters are called immediately (they do not wait for the EnterAction or ExitAction to complete). 
		NOTE - EnterActions and ExitActions are ignored on Event Triggers.
		XAML file -
			<Entry Placeholder="enter job title">
				<Entry.Triggers>
					<Trigger TargetType="Entry" Property="Entry.IsFocused" Value="True">
					<Trigger.EnterActions>
						<local:FadeTriggerAction StartsFrom="0"" />
					</Trigger.EnterActions>
					<Trigger.ExitActions>
						<local:FadeTriggerAction StartsFrom="1" />
					</Trigger.ExitActions>
					</Trigger>
				</Entry.Triggers>
			</Entry>
		C# file -
			public class FadeTriggerAction : TriggerAction<VisualElement>
			{
				public int StartsFrom { set; get; }
				protected override void Invoke (VisualElement visual)
				{
					visual.Animate("", 
						new Animation( (d)=>{var val = StartsFrom==1 ? d : 1-d;visual.BackgroundColor = Color.FromRgb(1, val, 1);}),
						length:1000,
						easing: Easing.Linear);
				}
			}
		

		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
Xamarin Forms Build Native Cross-platform Apps with C#
01 INTRO
	ObservableCollection<T> -
		implements INotifyPropertyChanged and INotifyCollectionChanged interfaces
		Represents a dynamic data collection that provides notifications when items get added or removed, and not when a property of an item is updated.
		INotifyPropertyChanged is applied to the properties of the list and not to the properties of the individual element
	INotifyPropertyChanged -
		PropertyChanged event(which is left for us to implement/raise/trigger), when raised, notifies subscribers that a property value has changed.
		example -
			public class TodoItem : INotifyPropertyChanged
			{
				private string _name;
				public event PropertyChangedEventHandler PropertyChanged;  // Occurs when a property value changes.
				public string Name
				{
					get { return _name; }
					set
					{
						if (value!=_name)
						{
							_name = value;
							NotifyPropertyChanged();
						}
					}
				}
				private void NotifyPropertyChanged([CallerMemberName] String propertyName = "")
				{
					// CallerMemberName causes the property name of the caller to be substituted as an argument
					PropertyChanged?.Invoke(this, new PropertyChangedEventArgs(propertyName));
				}
			}
	To disable back button press - override OnBackButtonPressed() in the intended page class
	The task which takes time should be placed under OnPageAppearing() and not under page's construction
	you can handle a page's control event in another page by making that control public like - public ListView ContactMethods{get{return listview;}}
02 XAML ESSENTIALS
	ContentPage class is decorated with ContentProperty("Content") attribute which means it has only one public property 'Content' of type View (single view).
	Since ContentPage has Content property, we can't have multiple controls/views as children. We can have only one control/view inside ContentPage.
	StackLayout is derived from Layout<View> which is decorated with ContentProperty("Children") attribute allowing it to have multiple controls/views.
	BindingContext - Source object to which binding is done
	Property Element Syntax - 
		Using XAML element instead of using XAML attribute. 
		For example '<ContentPage.Padding>...</ContentPage.Padding>'
		Used to represent complex value instead of string value
	Dealing With Device Differences - 
		C# code -
			switch (Device.RuntimePlatform)
            {
                case Device.iOS:
                    Padding = new Thickness(0, 20, 0, 0);
                    break;
                case Device.Android:
                    //...
                    break;
                default:
                    break;
            }
		XAML -
			<ContentPage.Padding>
				<OnPlatform x:DataType="Thickness" iOS="0,20,0,0" Android="..."/>
			</ContentPage.Padding>
	Bindable properties -
		Declaration -
			C# - 
				public partial class DateCell : ViewCell
				{
					public static readonly BindableProperty TitleProperty = BindableProperty.Create("Title", typeof(string), typeof(DateCell));
					public string Title
					{
						get { return (string)GetValue(TitleProperty); }
						set { SetValue(TitleProperty, value); }
					}
					public DateCell ()
					{
						InitializeComponent ();
						BindingContext = this;
					}
				}
			XAML -
				<ViewCell ... x:Class="App1.DateCell">
					<StackLayout Orientation="Horizontal" Padding="15,0">
						<Label Text="{Binding Title}" VerticalOptions="Center"/>
						<DatePicker Date="8 Apr 2019" HorizontalOptions="EndAndExpand"/>
					</StackLayout>
				</ViewCell>
		Usage XAML - <local:DateCell Title="Start"/>		
			
03 LAYOUTS
	StackLayout - 
		By default, VerticalOptions and HorizontalOptions is set to Fill (stretches to fill its parent container)
		Orientation has the value of Horizontal and Vertical(by default)
		Spacing is the space between the children while padding it the space between the layout and its children
	Grid - Use to position controls in row and column
		Grid stretches to fill its parent container
		properties - RowSpacing, ColumnSpacing, RowDefinitions, ColumnDefinitions
		attached bindable properties - Row, RowSpan, Column, ColumnSpan
		height/width of row/column can be absolute or proportional(*)(default) or Auto(enough to fill all its children)
	AbsoluteLayout - position the controls relative to the screen
		attached bindable properties - LayoutBounds(="anchorX,anchorY,width,height"), LayoutFlags(tells LayoutBounds's value is absolute or proportional)
		LayoutBounds value can be absolute(by default) or proportional(0-1 will means 0% to 100% of screen's width/height)
	RelativeLayout - position the controls relative to other control
		attached bindable properties - XConstraint,YConstraint,WidthConstraint,HeightConstraint,BoundsConstraint
		value of Constraint is XAML markup expression - {ConstraintExpression 
			Type=RelativeToParent/RelativeToView, 
			Property=...,  //generally Width or Height
			Factor=...,  // Property's Value multiplied by the Factor's Value
			Constant=...,  // Can be negative or positive
			ElementName=...}  // Needed only when Type is RelativeToView
		
04 IMAGES
	Image Sources
		Platform Independent (like background images)
			Download using URI
				var imageSource = (UriImageSource)ImageSource.FromUri(new Uri("http://lorempixel.com/1920/1080/sports/7/"));
				//or var imageSource = new UriImageSource() { Uri = new Uri("http://lorempixel.com/1920/1080/sports/7/") };
				imageSource.CachingEnabled = false;  //indicates whether caching is enabled on imageSource object. By default, it is true
				imageSource.CacheValidity = TimeSpan.FromHours(1);  //indicates the length of time after which image cache becomes invalid. Default - 1 Hour
			Embedded image
				Load image in the form project and set buildAction to EmbeddedResource in the image's properties
				In C# -
					image.Source = ImageSource.FromResource("<project namespace>.<folder>.<name of image>.<image extension>");
				In XAML - 
					create a MARKUP EXTENSION - EmbeddedImage.cs
						[ContentProperty("ResourceID")]
						class EmbeddedImage : IMarkupExtension
						{
							public string ResourceID { get; set; }
							public object ProvideValue(IServiceProvider serviceProvider)
							{
								return string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(ResourceID) ? null : ImageSource.FromResource(ResourceID);
							}
						}
					in xaml file -
						<ContentPage ... xmlns:local="clr-namespace:App1.MarkupExtention" x:Class="App1.MainPage">
							<Image Source="{local:EmbeddedImage ResourceID=App1.Images.background.jpg}" Aspect="AspectFill" />
							//since class is decorated with ContentProperty, we can skip writing ResourceID and can directly pass string value
						</ContentPage>
		Platform Specific (like icons, splash screen)
			Add to each application project
				Each project has its own rules of naming and storing different pixel-density images in the specified folders.
				The platform picks the right dimension image based on the device's pixel resolution
				example -
					<Image>
						<Image.Source>
							<OnPlatform x:DataType="FileImageSource" iOS="clock.png" Android="clock.png" UWP="Images/clock.png"/>
						</Image.Source>
					</Image>
	<Image Source="http://..."/> - Source is of type ImageSource(Abstract Class). 
		If the string value of Source starts with 'http', then it is implicitly converted into UriImageSource object.
		Otherwise, the string value is implicitly converted into FileImageSource object.
	Aspect - Scaling Mode of the image. Possible values - 
		AspectFill - Scale the image to fit the view. Some parts may be left empty (letter boxing).
		AspectFit(default) - Scale the image to fill the view. Some parts may be clipped in order to fill the view.
		Fill - Scale the image so it exactly fills the view. Scaling may not be uniform in X and Y.
	Use of ActivityIndicator with image -
		<ActivityIndicator IsRunning="{Binding Source={x:Reference image},Path=IsLoading}"/>
        <Image Source="http://lorempixel.com/1920/1080/sports/7/" x:Name="image"/>
		
05 LISTS
	data template
		<ListView x:Name="listview" HasUnevenRows="True">
			<ListView.ItemTemplate>
				<DataTemplate>
					<!--<TextCell Text="{Binding Name}" Detail="{Binding Description}"/>--> <!--inbulid data template-->
					<!--<ImageCell Text="{Binding Name}" Detail="{Binding Description}" ImageSource="{Binding ImageUrl}"/>-->  <!--inbulid data template-->
					<ViewCell>  <!--custom data template-->
						<StackLayout Orientation="Horizontal" Padding="5">
							<Image Source="{Binding ImageUrl}"/>
							<StackLayout HorizontalOptions="StartAndExpand">
								<Label Text="{Binding Name}"/>
								<Label Text="{Binding Description}"/>
							</StackLayout>
							<Button Text="Follow"/>
						</StackLayout>
					</ViewCell>
				</DataTemplate>
			</ListView.ItemTemplate>
		</ListView>
	grouping items
		C# -
			public class Contact
			{
				public string Name { get; set; }
				public string Description { get; set; }
				public string ImageUrl { get; set; }
			}
			public class GroupContacts : List<Contact>
			{
				public string Title { get; set; }
				public string ShortTitle { get; set; }
				public GroupContacts(string title,string shortTitle)
				{
					Title = title;
					ShortTitle = shortTitle;
				}
			}
		XAML -
			<ListView x:Name="listview" HasUnevenRows="True" 
				IsGroupingEnabled="True"   <!--set IsGroupingEnabled to True-->
				GroupDisplayBinding="{Binding Title}" 
				GroupShortNameBinding="{Binding ShortTitle}">
				<ListView.ItemTemplate>
					<DataTemplate>...</DataTemplate>
				</ListView.ItemTemplate>
			</ListView>
	context actions
		XAML -
			<ListView.ItemTemplate>
				<DataTemplate>
					<ViewCell>
						...
						<ViewCell.ContextActions>
							<MenuItem Text="Call" Clicked="MenuItem_Call_Clicked" CommandParameter="{Binding .}"/>
							<MenuItem Text="Delete" Clicked="MenuItem_Delete_Clicked" IsDestructive="True" CommandParameter="{Binding .}"/>
						</ViewCell.ContextActions>
					</ViewCell>
				</DataTemplate>
			</ListView.ItemTemplate>
		C# -
			private void MenuItem_Call_Clicked(object sender, EventArgs e)
			{
				MenuItem menuItem = sender as MenuItem;
				Contact contact = menuItem.CommandParameter as Contact;
				DisplayAlert("Call", string.Format("Call {0}", contact.Name), "OK");
			}
	pull to refresh
		XAML - <ListView x:Name="listview" IsPullToRefreshEnabled="True" Refreshing="Listview_Refreshing">...</ListView>
		C# -
			private void Listview_Refreshing(object sender, EventArgs e)
			{
				_contacts.Add(new Contact() { Name = "Mohan", ImageUrl = "http://lorempixel.com/100/100/people/5" });
				listview.ItemsSource = _contacts;
				listview.EndRefresh();  // Exits the refreshing state by setting the ListView.IsRefreshing property to false.
			}
	search bar
		XAML -
			<SearchBar Placeholder="Search..." TextChanged="SearchBar_TextChanged"/>
			<ListView x:Name="listview">...</ListView>
		C# -
			private void SearchBar_TextChanged(object sender, TextChangedEventArgs e)
			{
				if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(e.NewTextValue))
					listview.ItemsSource = _contacts;
				else
					listview.ItemsSource = _contacts.Where(c => c.Name.ToLower().Contains(e.NewTextValue.ToLower()));
			}
		
06 NAVIGATION
	Hierarchical Navigation
		Has a concept of Root page and Active page.
		Have to instantiate NavigationPage by passing Root Page - MainPage = new NavigationPage(new MainPage());
		While instantiating NavigationPage, you can set BarBackgroundColor and BarTextColor
		Push Page on another page - await Navigation.PushAsync(new Page1());
		Pop the top active page - await Navigation.PopAsync();
		NavigationPage has few attached properties - BackButtonTitle, HasBackButton, HasNavigationBar, TitleIcon, etc
	Modal Page Navigation
		Xamarin has a stack for Modal pages. Has no navigation bar
		Push modal page on another page - await Navigation.PushModalAsync(new Page1());
		Pop the top modal page - await Navigation.PopModalAsync();
	MasterDetailPage
		Has two Master and Detail properties of type Page
		If you want to hide the Master Page, set IsPresented to false
	TabbedPage
		Type of the Children property is IList<Page>
	CarouselPage
		Type of the Children property is IList<ContentPage>
	displaying Popup
		string response = await DisplayActionSheet("Title", "Cancel", "Delete", "Btn1", "Btn2");
		bool response = await DisplayAlert("Title", "Message", "OK", "Cancel");
		await DisplayAlert("Title", "Message", "OK");
	Toolbar item
		toolbar is only visible in NavigationPage
		Declaring ToolbarItems -
			<ContentPage.ToolbarItems>
				<ToolbarItem Name="Alert" Icon="<image_source>" Activated="Button_Clicked" Order="Primary" IsDestructive="True"/>
			</ContentPage.ToolbarItems>
		
07 FORMS AND SETTING PAGES
	Switch - <Switch IsToggled="True" Toggled="Switch_Toggled"/>
	Slider -
		<Slider Maximum="200" Minimum="10" Value="50" ValueChanged="Slider_ValueChanged"/>
		The order in which the properties are set is important. If Minimum is first, then app fails as Max(1,by default) is less than Min(10)
	Stepper - <Stepper Maximum="200" Minimum="10" Value="50" Increment="5" ValueChanged="Stepper_ValueChanged"/>
	Entry(single line) - <Entry Placeholder="Phone" Keyboard="Numeric" Completed="Entry_Completed" TextChanged="Entry_TextChanged"/>
	Editor(multi line) - <Editor AutoSize="TextChanges" IsSpellCheckEnabled="True"/>
	Picker -
		Picker is only useful when the list is small. When list gets big, navigate user to next page to choose an item
		ex - 
			XAML -
				<Picker x:Name="picker" Title="Pick Method" SelectedIndexChanged="Picker_SelectedIndexChanged">
					<Picker.Items>
						<x:String>SMS</x:String>
						<x:String>Phone</x:String>
					</Picker.Items>
				</Picker>
			C# -
				private void Picker_SelectedIndexChanged(object sender, EventArgs e)
				{
					string value = picker.SelectedItem.ToString();
					DisplayAlert("Selection", value, "OK");
				}
	DatePicker and timePicker -
		<ContentPage ... xmlns:sys="clr-namespace:System;assembly=netstandard" x:Class="App1.TabPage1" Title="My Page">
			<StackLayout HorizontalOptions="CenterAndExpand" VerticalOptions="CenterAndExpand">
				<DatePicker Date="{x:Static sys:DateTime.Today}" Format="d MMM yyyy" MinimumDate="1 Jan 2019" DateSelected="DatePicker_DateSelected"/>
			</StackLayout>   
		</ContentPage>
	Table View -
		It is group of Sections where each Section got list of Cells
		example - 
			<TableView Intent="Form"> <!--Intent provides hints to the renderer about how a table will be used-->
				<TableRoot> <!--As TableView is decorated with [ContentProperty("Root")] and Root is of type TableRoot-->
					<TableSection Title="Basics">
						<TextCell Text="Name" Detail="Ritesh Raj"/>
						<ImageCell Text="Name" Detail="Ritesh Raj" ImageSource="http://lorempixel.com/100/100/people/1/"/>
						<EntryCell Placeholder="(eg Ritesh Raj)" Label="Name"/>
						<SwitchCell Text="Notifications" On="True"/>
					</TableSection>
					<TableSection Title="ViewCell Demo">
						<ViewCell> <!--Custom Cell-->
							<StackLayout Orientation="Horizontal" Padding="15,0">
								<Label Text="Date" VerticalOptions="Center"/>
								<DatePicker Date="8 Apr 2019" HorizontalOptions="EndAndExpand"/>
							</StackLayout>
						</ViewCell>
					</TableSection>
				</TableRoot>
			</TableView>
	
08 DATA ACCESS
	Ways to store data - Application Properties, File System, SQLite, and Cloud(API)
	Application.Current.Properties -
		It of type IDictionary<string,object>
		Used to store persistent application state, in the device's permanent storage, across all application code when the application is paused or shut down.
		Values saved in the properties dictionary must be primitive types, such as integers or strings. 
		Attempting to save reference types, or collections in particular, can fail silently.
		SavePropertiesAsync() - store data immediately, rather than waiting for a life cycle event to trigger the data to be saved.
		You can override OnDisappearing() of the Page to store persistent application state
	File System -
		********* getting UnauthorizedAccessException when reading file******** I have to cover this topic
		https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/app-fundamentals/files?tabs=windows
		AS per Video, use PCLStorage
	SQLite
		Xamarin.Forms supports database-driven applications using the SQLite database engine, which makes it possible to load and save objects in shared code
		steps
			add sqlite-net-pcl by Frank A. Krueger NuGet package
			create database class -
				public class TodoItemDatabase
				{
					readonly SQLiteAsyncConnection database;
					public TodoItemDatabase(string dbPath)
					{
						database = new SQLiteAsyncConnection(dbPath);  // a local file path for storing the database
						database.CreateTableAsync<TodoItem>().Wait();
					}
					public Task<List<TodoItem>> GetItemsAsync()
					{
						return database.Table<TodoItem>().ToListAsync();
					}
					// some more useful methods of querying table
					// GetItemsNotDoneAsync() - database.QueryAsync<TodoItem>("SELECT * FROM [TodoItem] WHERE [Done] = 0");
					// GetItemAsync(int id) - database.Table<TodoItem>().Where(i => i.ID == id).FirstOrDefaultAsync();
					// InsertItemAsync(TodoItem item) - database.InsertAsync(item);
					// UpdateItemAsync(TodoItem item) - database.UpdateAsync(item);
					// DeleteItemAsync(TodoItem item) - database.DeleteAsync(item);
				}
			add a property to the App class that returns the reference to the database class
				static TodoItemDatabase _database;
				public static TodoItemDatabase Database
				{
					get
					{
						if (_database == null)
						{
							_database = new TodoItemDatabase(
							  System.IO.Path.Combine(Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.LocalApplicationData), "TodoSQLite.db3"));
						}
						return _database;
					}
				}
			Use the database property defined in the App class to perform operation on SQLite table
				var todoItems = await App.Database.GetItemsAsync();
				await App.Database.InsertItemAsync(todoItem);
				await App.Database.DeleteItemAsync(todoItem);
				await App.Database.UpdateItemAsync(todoItem);
		Advantage of exposing the database as a singleton -
			A single database connection is created that's kept open while the application runs
			Therefore avoiding the expense of opening and closing the database file each time a database operation is performed.
		The advantage of using the asynchronous SQLite.Net API is that database operations are moved to background threads
	Restful service -
		Include Newtonsoft.Json and System.Net.Http packages in your solution
		Get All Content
			var content = await _client.GetStringAsync(URL);
            var posts = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<List<Post>>(content);
		Post Content
			var content = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(post);
            await _client.PostAsync(URL, new StringContent(content));
		Update - await _client.PutAsync(URL, new StringContent(content));
		Delete - await _client.DeleteAsync(URL + "/" + post.Id);
09 MODEL-VIEW-VIEWMODEL ARCHITECTURAL PATTERN
	ViewModel - Contains the state(properties) and behavior(methods) of the View
	Extracting a View Model - 
		Replace any reference to UI objects with data-binding. For example, this.Title = ...(C#) should be replaced with <...Title={Binding...}../>(XAML)
		Move Event Handlers(like click, itemSelect events) to view model 
	Dealing With Xamarin Dependencies
		Create interface - 
			interface IPageService
			{
				Task PushAsync(Page page);
			}
		Implement the interface
			class PageService : IPageService
			{
				public async Task PushAsync(Page page)
				{
					await Application.Current.MainPage.Navigation.PushAsync(page);
				}
			}
		Use the class in the ViewModel
			....
			private PageService _pageService;
			public PlaylistsPageViewModel()
			{
				_pageService = new PageService();
			}
			...
			//await Navigation.PushAsync (new PlaylistDetailPage(playlist));
            await _pageService.PushAsync (new PlaylistDetailPage(playlist));
	ICommand Interface
		The value for the Command bindable property is of ICommand type
		Constructor of Command Class -
			Command<T>(Action<T> execute);
			Command(Action execute);
			Command<T>(Action<T> execute, Func<T, bool> canExecute);
			Command(Action execute, Func<bool> canExecute);
		Example -
			XAML -
				<ToolbarItem Text="Add" Command="{Binding AddPlaylistCommand}" />
				...
				<ListView ItemsSource="{Binding Playlists}" SelectedItem="{Binding SelectedPlaylist, Mode=TwoWay}" ItemSelected="OnPlaylistSelected">...
			Behind-Code -
				void OnPlaylistSelected(object sender, SelectedItemChangedEventArgs e)
				{
					(BindingContext as PlaylistsPageViewModel).SelectPlaylistCommand.Execute(e.SelectedItem);
				}
			PlaylistsPageViewModel.cs -
				public ICommand AddPlaylistCommand { get; private set; }
				public ICommand SelectPlaylistCommand { get; private set; }
				public PlaylistsPageViewModel()
				{
					AddPlaylistCommand = new Command(AddPlaylist); // without parameter
					SelectPlaylistCommand = new Command<PlaylistViewModel>(async vm => await SelectPlaylist(vm));  // with parameter
				}
				public void AddPlaylist(){...}
				public async Task SelectPlaylist(PlaylistViewModel playlist){...}
				
BEYOND THE BASICS
	Resource Dictionary
		It is used when multiple elements have same value for a property. Used to make the XAML file clean and modularized
		Can be initialized at application, page or element level
		Use resource dictionary carefully as it degrades the performance.
		declaring at page level -
			<ContentPage.Resources>
				<ResourceDictionary>  // initializing the dictionary
					<x:Int32 x:Key="borderRadius">20</x:Int32>
					<Color x:Key="buttonBackgroundcolor">Yellow</Color>
				</ResourceDictionary>
			</ContentPage.Resources>
			<Button BackgroundColor="{StaticResource buttonBackgroundcolor}" BorderWidth="{StaticResource borderWidth}"/>
	Dynamic Resources
		StaticResource uses a resource only once during initialization. If you try to change the resource during runtime, the element won't be aware of it.
		Use DynamicResource if you want to change the resource value at the runtime -
			XAML -
				<Button BackgroundColor="{DynamicResource buttonBackgroundcolor}" Clicked="Button_Clicked"/>
			C# -
				private void Button_Clicked(object sender, EventArgs e)
				{
					this.Resources["buttonBackgroundcolor"] = Color.Green;
				}
	Styles
		Style is defined under ResourceDictionary. Style is the collection of setter elements
		example -
			<Style x:Key="buttonStyle" TargetType="Button">
                <Setter Property="BackgroundColor" Value="Pink"/>
                <Setter Property="TextColor" Value="White"/>
                <Setter Property="CornerRadius" Value="15"/>
                <Setter Property="FontFamily" Value="Bold"/>                
            </Style>
		TargetType is mandatory. If you skip x:Key, then all buttons at that level will have same style
		Style element act as a object. If you have style at App and page level, then only page level's setter will be applied.
		For inheritance to work, use 'BasedOn' attribute of style 
		You can also overwrite setter property by setting that property directly at he element level
	Messaging Center
		MainPage.xaml.cs -
			private async void Button_Clicked(object sender, EventArgs e)
			{
				MessagingCenter.Subscribe<NextPage, double>(this, "sliderValueChanged", (nextpage, val) => { label.Text = val.ToString(); });
				await Navigation.PushAsync(new NextPage());
				MessagingCenter.Unsubscribe<NextPage>(this, "sliderValueChanged");
			}
		NextPage.xaml.cs - 
			private void Slider_ValueChanged(object sender, ValueChangedEventArgs e)
			{
				MessagingCenter.Send<NextPage, double>(this, "sliderValueChanged", e.NewValue);
			}
